# The Center for Bionic Medicine — Shirley Ryan Ability Lab 

The overarching vision of [The Regenstein Foundation Center for Bionic Medicine \(CBM\)](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/bionic-medicine) is to develop, evaluate, and translate transformative technology to advance human ability in partnership with the Shirley Ryan Ability Labs.

In support of this vision, an interdisciplinary staff of more than 63 innovators — physicians, prosthetists, therapists, engineers, software developers, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students — collaborate closely to develop and field test next-generation artificial limbs, exoskeletons, and other robotic devices.

Specific areas of expertise of the team include:

* Control System Development
* Machine Learning and Data Science
* Device Design
* Device Evaluation
* Surgical Technique Development
* Wearable and Implantable Sensing

Collectively, the CBM team has published more than 200 articles in peer-reviewed journals and has been awarded more than $25 million in grant funding from federal, military and philanthropic sources.
